<h4 align="center">The rewrite of Rem, now even cleaner and soon fully documented. This is rem-v2's fork. This is the replica version that fixed the bug in rem-v2.</h4>

## Noteworthy Forks
There are some forks which deserve to be listed here since they added some new features to rem
- PaveLiArcH: [https://github.com/PaveLiArcH/rem-v2](https://github.com/PaveLiArcH/rem-v2)
## Contributing Guidelines

I will write those if people actually want to contribute. Until then: Just make it work good and fast. uwu

## Modifications compared to original Rem

- Fully containerized
- Fully re-implemented Cleverot module, now supporting current API
- Removed all NSFW commands
- Moderation features:
    - Logs all edited messages to some hardcoded channel ID
- Japanese commands:
    - `!w.kanji <kanji>` sends an embed with meanings, readings, misc infos, and uploads an animation of how to write the character
    - `!w.jisho [definition number] <keywords>` queries Jisho.org to send an embed with all relevant dictionary information
    - `!w.read <japanese sentence>` uses Mecab to generate a kana-only version of provided sentence
- Easter eggs commands:
    - `!w.master` to show who's really boss
    - `!w.react <letters>` makes Rem react to this message with letter emojis (hits rate-limitting fast)

## Building requirements:

### Configuration files

Place `main.json` and `keys.json` (format [below](#configuration-format)) in a folder called `config/`

### Resources

- Translations:
    - Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
- Kanji stroke order animations:
    - Download [KanjiVG main SVGs](https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg/releases)
    - Generate animation gifs with [Kanimaji](https://github.com/maurimo/kanimaji)
    - Use the default settings, but with a white background and only produce gifs
    - Use `scripts/kanimaji_batch.py` to generate animations for all SVGs (takes about 20 hours on a MBP 2016)
    - Archive all generated GIFs in a compressed tarall named `kanji.tar.gz` located in `kanji/`
- Kanji information:
    - Download the [JSON version of KANJIDIC2](https://github.com/shawnps/kanjidic2-json)
    - Use `scripts/convert_kanjidic2.py` to convert it to a more convenient format
    - Place output in `kanji/kanji.json`

## Requirements:
* Node and NPM
* Git
* MongoDB (follow instructions on how to configure the server at [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/))
* Redis, which can be found here: [redis](https://redis.io/download)
* ffmpeg and youtube-dl
* Buildtools and Python 2.7
* Basic understanding of node js

## Installation instructions

1. Install MongoDB with the [guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).
2. Install redis with the [guide](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
2. Install git, Here is the [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to get it.
3. Install node, Here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) to get it.
4. Install ffmpeg and add it to path, it can be found [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), if you are on linux, you might wanna compile it, here is a [guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu) for that
5. If you have Windows, open a console with administrator permissions and type `npm install --global windows-build-tools` into it.
This will install the neccessary tools, which will be later needed by npm to build Rems dependencies.
6. For Linux environments, you should get `build-essential` and `python 2.7` installed.
7. Clone the source of v2 from git
8. Go into the just created directory and open a cmd and execute `npm install`.
There could be some errors while installing the dependencies as the optional dependency of rem links to `eris-crystal`
If the installation fails, due to not being able to clone the git repo of it, remove it from the dependencies in the package.json.
9. Create the following directories within the root: `temp`,`audio`,`config`
10. Create 2 files within the config directory: `main.json` and `keys.json`. An Example can be found down below.
11. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the newest translations
13. Start the MongoDB Server and the Redis Server if you did not do that already
14. Start Rem by going into the src folder and typing the following:  `node index.js`.

### ***Example main.json***
```json
{
  "owner": "Owner Name",
  "owner_id": "Owner ID",
  "environment": "development",
  "no_error_tracking": true,
  "token": "Bot Token",
  "client_id": "Bot Client ID",
  "bot_id": "Bot ID (Same as Client ID)",
  "osu_token": "OSU API TOKEN",
  "osu_username": "osu username",
  "osu_password": "osu password",
  "soundcloud_key": "key for the soundcloud api",
  "sentry_token": "not needed.",
  "lbsearch_sfw_key": "ibsear.ch key",
  "lbsearch_nsfw_key": "ibsearch.xxx key",
  "cleverbot_api_key": "cleverbot.com api key",
  "dialogflow_api_key": "dialogflow api key",
  "use_dialogflow": false,
  "mashape_key": "mashape key",
  "use_ws": false,
  "master_hostname": "not needed.",
  "mongo_hostname": "The full database adress: e.g. mongodb://host:port/dbname",
  "redis_enabled": true,
  "redis_hostname": "the redis ip, port is automatically set to 6379",
  "redis_database": 2,
  "shard_token": "not needed."
}
```
- no_error_tracking disables sentry, the bugtracker of rem, leave this set to true.
- use_ws tells rem whether the master server should be used or not, leave this set to false, as it is not needed with one shard.
- the number of shards defines how many processes the master will spawn.
 Can be set to 1 unless you want to operate this fork on over 2500 servers.

## Example keys.json
```json
{
  "keys": [
    "Youtube Api Key, you can add more if you like"
  ]
}
```

## Helpful links
If you need help creating tokens and a Youtube api I suggest reading these two tutorials on it.
